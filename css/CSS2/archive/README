CSS2.1 Test Suite
=================

QUICK START

 - The source of tests are in one of these:

       raw-tests/ -- tests that have a special file that is then used
       to create the tests, adding <link> elements and fixing the
       filename.

       cooked-tests/ -- tests that already have appropriate filenames
       and <link> elements.

 - To build the tests, run 'make' in this directory. Build requirements
   are documented in http://csswg.inkedblade.net/test/css2.1/harness

DETAILS

Existing tests from the Web are converted to XHTML1.1 by conversion
scripts in the convertors/ directory. These tests are then placed in
the incoming-tests/ directory, where the test bodies and stylesheets
are examined one by one and made to fit the CSS2.1 guidelines by hand.
After this stage, tests are placed in a raw-tests/.../ directory.
Support files are placed in raw-tests/.../support/ at this stage.
These raw tests should all be fully valid XHTML1.1, but need not have
the right <link rel="help"> lines or the right filenames.

Raw tests are then examined and a file is made giving each raw test's
right filename and metadata. This is put into raw-tests/.../FILENAMES.
Then, the make-proper-tests.pl script is pointed at raw-tests/.../,
and puts the resulting tests in the tests/ directory. Support files
are also copied to tests/support/.

   rm -rf tests/*.xht
   find raw-tests -name FILENAMES | xargs -n 1 perl make-proper-tests.pl
   rm -rf tests/support/.unused

The generate.pl script takes the tests in the tests/ directory and
creates the various final tests, which it outputs in the dist/
directory, along with navigation files and the support files. It uses
routines in the lib/ directory.

   rm -rf dist/
   mkdir dist
   perl generate.pl tests/*.xht
   cp -Lrv tests/support dist/support

Then all the tests are in dist/ and ready.
